## Git strategy
### Project uses GitFlow, meaning that the master branch is the pure production code, and the development features are branched rom the development branch, and then pushed back into development once tested.

### Once we have a stable development branch we create a release branch from it.
### The release branch is tested and pushed to master once quality is assured.
